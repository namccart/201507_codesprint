GrTemplate is a minimal Android application that initializes and starts
a very simple GNU Radio flowgraph. This project is intended to be an
instructive template for people to use when building their own GNU
Radio based Android apps. The settings and configuration files in this
project are the basic boiler-plate necessary to compile and run an
application with GNU Radio.

Follow the steps for building the dependencies, GNU Radio, and the
walk-through for building a basic app on the GNU Radio on Android
webpage:

- http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/Android

If evolving this app, the app name is GrTemplate, and the main
activity is GrTemplate.java. The organization domain is
gnuradio.org. All of these will need to be changed to provide the
correct information to your app.
